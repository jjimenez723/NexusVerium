The carbon market suffers from a credibility problem. "Paper parks" and inflated baselines have eroded trust. The solution lies in verifiable, independent observation.

## Multi-Spectral Analysis

Using Sentinel-2 and Landsat data, we can track biomass density changes over time. But optical imagery isn't enough—it sees the canopy, not the carbon.

By integrating **LiDAR** and **SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar)**, we can penetrate the canopy to measure volumetric structure. This gives us a 3D view of the forest or wetland, allowing for mass calculations with +/- 10% error margins, vastly superior to the industry standard of +/- 30%.

This isn't just about accounting; it's about holding the market accountable to the physical reality of the planet.
