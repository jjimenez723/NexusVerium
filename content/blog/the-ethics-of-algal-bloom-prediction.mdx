Harmful Algal Blooms (HABs) are not just ecological disasters; they are public health crises. With recent advances in satellite telemetry and machine learning, we can now predict bloom events with 85% accuracy up to a week in advance. But this capability brings a new set of ethical questions.

## The Prediction Paradox

If a model predicts a bloom that would devastate a local fishery, but the probability is only 60%, should the fishery be closed preemptively? Closing it saves health costs but destroys livelihoods. Keeping it open risks public safety.

At Nexus Verium, we believe that AI systems must output not just probabilities, but *actionable context*. We don't just say "Bloom Likely." We provide:

1. **Confidence Intervals**: Clearly communicating uncertainty.
2. **Impact Zones**: Delineating exactly which areas are at risk.
3. **Historical Precedent**: Showing similar past events to aid human decision-making.

## Beyond Binary Classification

Traditional models classify water as "Safe" or "Unsafe." We advocate for a gradient approach, allowing stakeholders to make granular decisions based on their specific risk tolerance.
