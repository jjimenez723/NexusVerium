Wetlands are chaotic systems. A change in water level by a few centimeters can alter the entire vegetative profile. Traditional hydraulic modeling (HEC-RAS, etc.) is excellent for physics-based simulation but struggles with biological complexity.

Enter Transformer models—the same architecture behind LLMs.

## Attention Is All You Need (For Hydrology)

Transformers excel at tracking "long-distance dependencies." In language, this means linking a noun to a verb in a long sentence. In wetlands, it means linking a rainfall event in the upper watershed to a salinity spike in the estuary three days later.

By training on decades of sensor data, we can build models that "pay attention" to the specific lag times and non-linear correlations that drive wetland health.

### Case Study: The Everglades

In a recent pilot, we used a temporal transformer to predict hydro-periods for a restoration site. The model identified that *wind direction*, historically ignored in standard models, was a critical predictor of water depth during dry seasons.
